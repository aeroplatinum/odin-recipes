    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Crumbed fish is one of my favorite fried items, and this air-fried version of the recipe gives me great flavor without the fat.
      </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs </li>
      <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil </li>
      <li>4 flounder fillets </li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
      <li>1 lemon, sliced </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Mix bread crumbs and oil together in a bowl. Stir until mixture becomes loose and crumbly.
